# Two Sum

## Question

Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns an array of indices where the sum of the elements at those indices is equal to 10. The returned array should not contain any duplicates, and the indices should be in ascending order.

Example input: [3, 4, 1, 7, 6, 9]

Example output: [0, 4]

### Write two versions of the function:

1. The first version should use a nested loop to compare each element with all the others in the array. ([a link](https://github.com/Mnatsakanyan1996/Algorithms/blob/main/TwoSum/first-version.js))

2. The second version should use a single loop to find pairs of elements that sum up to 10 in the array. ([a link](https://github.com/Mnatsakanyan1996/Algorithms/blob/main/TwoSum/second-version.js))

For each version of the function, provide a description of the algorithm used and a sample implementation in JavaScript.
